# BlinkActivator

An Android project that could be used to automatically arm and disarm [Blink security cameras](https://blinkforhome.com/) based on the user's proximity from home.

This project was a request from my Wife who was tired of forgetting to arm blink, or, arming blink but then not disarming until already home, once the security cameras had already recorded her.

At the time of writing the project, Blink had an HTTP API that could be used to query cameras, get/set automatic scheduling, and arm/disarm. Unforunately, on 5/11 Blink notifeid me that they are no longer accepting requests on this API and that I should instead onboard with  IFTTT. This is still an outstanding step.
