Add ability to pause and resume
Show when blink is not available (grey out map?)
Show reason for blink being available (not initialised, paused, out of schedule, unknown)

add settings

prevent notification on app pause? wait until it is destroyed? should we use a background service?


nicer looking UI, take assets from blink?
rename?

add more sophisticated scheduling?
