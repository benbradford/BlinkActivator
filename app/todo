Add notification buttons
Open, Pause, Stop


Add ability to pause and resume in activity
Show when blink is paused (grey out map? or just in status message?)

improve handling of when foreground service is launched

nicer looking UI, take assets from blink?
rename? blinko?

add more sophisticated scheduling?
